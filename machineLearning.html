                <p class="parteUm__texto-Paragrafo">A computer “learns” when the software is able to successfully predict and react to unfolding scenarios based on past results. Machine learning is the process by which computers develop pattern recognition or the ability to continually learn or make predictions based on data, and can make adjustments without being specifically programmed to do so. A form of  artificial intelligence , machine learning efficiently automates the process of building analytical models and allows machines to adapt to new scenarios independently.
                    The four steps of building a machine learning model are:
                </br></br>
                    1. Select and prepare a training dataset needed to solve the problem. This data can be labeled or unlabeled.
                </br></br>    
                    2. Choose an algorithm to run on the training data.
                    If the data is labeled, the algorithm can be based on regression, decision trees, or instances.
                    If the data is not labeled, the algorithm can be a cluster algorithm, an association algorithm, or a neural network.
                </br></br>    
                    3. Train the algorithm to create the model.
                </br></br>    
                    4. Use and improve the model.
                    There are three methods of machine learning: “supervised” learning works with labeled data and requires less training. “Unsupervised” learning is used to classify unlabeled data by identifying patterns and relationships. “Semi-supervised” learning uses a small set of labeled data to guide classification of a larger set of unlabeled data.

                <p class="parteDois__texto-paragrafo">Deep learning  is a subset of machine learning that has been shown to significantly
                    outperform some traditional machine learning methods. Deep learning uses a combination of multi-layered artificial neural
                    networks and data- and computing-intensive training, inspired by the latest understanding of the behavior of the human brain.
                    This approach has become so effective that it has even begun to surpass human abilities in a number of areas such as image
                    and voice recognition and natural language processing.
                    Deep learning models process large amounts of data and are often unsupervised or semi-supervised.
