                         AI is now part of our daily lives. We have AI solutions for quality control,
                         video analytics, speech-to-text (natural language processing) and autonomous driving,
                         as well as solutions in healthcare, manufacturing, financial services and entertainment.

                        <p class="textoDois__paragrafo">Before 1949, computers could execute commands,
                                but they couldn't remember what they had done, because they weren't able
                                to store those commands. In 1950 Alan Turing discussed how to create intelligent
                                machines and test that intelligence in his study “ Computational Machines and Intelligence ”.
                                Five years later, the first  AI program  was featured at  Dartmouth's Summer Research Project
                                on Artificial Intelligence (DSPRAI) . This event catalyzed AI research for the next few decades.
                                Computers became faster, cheaper, and more affordable between 1957 and 1974. Machine learning
                                algorithms improved, and in 1970, one of the DSPRAI makers told Life magazine that there would be
                                a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being in three to three years.
                                eight years. Despite the success, the inability of computers to efficiently store and process
                                information quickly created obstacles in the search for artificial intelligence for the next ten years.

                                dedicated funds. John Hopefield and David Rumelhart presented the “deep learning” techniques that allowed
                                computers to learn from experience. Edward Feigenbaum introduced “expert systems” that simulated human decision
                                making. Despite a lack of government funding and advertising, AI thrived and many important milestones were reached
                                in the next two decades. In 1997, then-current world champion and chess grandmaster Gary Kasparov was defeated by IBM's
                                Deep Blue, a computer program that plays chess. In the same year, speech recognition software developed by Dragon
                                Systems was implemented on Windows. Cynthia Breazeal also developed  Kismet, a robot that could recognize and show
                                emotions. In 2016, Google's AlphaGo program  defeated Go master Lee Se-dol  , and in 2017, Libratus, a poker-playing
                                supercomputer,  defeated  the best human players.
