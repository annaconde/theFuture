                <p class="parteUm__paragrafo">After centuries of theories, decades of research and years of publicity, artificial intelligence
                    has finally started to take effect in companies, where it is poised to become a mainstream resource. In a recent industry
                    survey, 50% of respondents said they have implemented an AI initiative, have one in the proof-of-concept stage, or intend
                    to have one by next year</p>

                <p class="parteDois__paragrafo">AI has the unique ability to extract meaning from data when you can define what the answer
                    should be, but you don't know how to get there. AI is capable of expanding human resources and transforming exponentially
                    growing data into insights, actions and value.
                    Today, AI is used in a variety of applications across industries including healthcare, manufacturing and government. Here
                    are some specific use cases:
                    Prescriptive maintenance and quality control  improve production, manufacturing and retail through an open IT/OT framework.
                    Integrated solutions recommend the best maintenance decisions, automate actions, and improve quality control processes by
                    implementing enterprise AI-based computer vision techniques.
                    Speech and language  processing transforms unstructured audio data into insights and intelligence. It automates the
                    understanding of spoken and written languages ​​with machines, using natural language processing, transcript analysis,
                    biometric search or real-time call monitoring.
                    Video analytics and surveillance  automatically analyze video to detect events, reveal identity, environment and people,
                    and gain operational insights. They use edge-to-core video analytics systems for a wide variety of workloads and operating
                    conditions.
                    Highly autonomous driving is built on top of a scale -  out data ingestion platform to create an ideal highly autonomous
                    driving solution that is tuned around open source services, machine learning and deep learning neural networks.
